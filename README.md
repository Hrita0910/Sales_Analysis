# Sales_Analysis

The project "Sales data analysis" focuses on analyzing sales data from various stores. It involves loading a dataset, exploring its structure, and performing data analysis to uncover insights about sales performance.

In it, I imported key libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to facilitate data manipulation and visualization. The methods that are applied in the project are:
cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features if necessary. 

Then, identify the most relevant features that impact store sales. This could involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships and correlations. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

Choose appropriate algorithms for regression, such as linear regression, decision trees, or more complex models like random forests or gradient boosting, depending on the complexity of the data.
Train the selected model on the training dataset, adjusting parameters as needed to optimize performance.Assess the model using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared to determine how well it predicts store sales on the test set.

Analyze the model results to draw insights about which factors most significantly influence sales, aiding in business decision-making.
